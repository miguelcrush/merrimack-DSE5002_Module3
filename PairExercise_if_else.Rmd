## if-else

### Pair programming exercise for DSE5002,  on if and else operations

when the test condition in an if statement is met, then the following
code block is run.   Otherwise, not

if(condiction)
{
   ...put some commands here
}

Suppose if x is less than 10, then we want to set y=0.125*x and z to x squared

This looks like

```{R}
y=0
z=0
x=5

if(x<10)
{
  y=0.125*x
  z=x^2
}
#cat is a print function I am using here, the \n is a linefeed character
# to advance to the next line in the printing

cat("Y is ",y ,"\n")
cat("Z is ",z)
```

## *Action Required:  alter my code so that Y and Z are not altered*
```{R}
y=0
z=0
x=5

if(FALSE)
{
  y=0.125*x
  z=x^2
}
#cat is a print function I am using here, the \n is a linefeed character
# to advance to the next line in the printing

cat("Y is ",y ,"\n")
cat("Z is ",z)
```


#If-else

Suppose that when x<10,  we want this calculation to run as above, but for
other x values, we want y=0.25*x, and z=square root of x

We use an else statement

```{R}
y=0
z=0
x=5

if(x<10)
{
  y=0.125*x
  z=x^2
}else
{
  y=0.25*x
  z=x^(0.5)
}
#cat is a print function I am using here, the \n is a linefeed character
# to advance to the next line in the printing

cat("Y is ",y ,"\n")
cat("Z is ",z)

```
## *Action Required:*

Verify that this code works for a couple of different values of x

```{R}
y=0
z=0
x=11

if(x<10)
{
  y=0.125*x
  z=x^2
}else
{
  y=0.25*x
  z=x^(0.5)
}
#cat is a print function I am using here, the \n is a linefeed character
# to advance to the next line in the printing

cat("Y is ",y ,"\n")
cat("Z is ",z, "\n")

y=0
z=0
x=-5

if(x<10)
{
  y=0.125*x
  z=x^2
}else
{
  y=0.25*x
  z=x^(0.5)
}
#cat is a print function I am using here, the \n is a linefeed character
# to advance to the next line in the printing

cat("Y is ",y ,"\n")
cat("Z is ",z, "\n")

```

Note

Each if statement can only have one else

We can put if statements inside elses to allow for more possible options

```{R}
x=-1
if(x<0)
{
  cat("Negative X value\n")
}else
{if(x%%2==1)
  {
    cat("X is even\n")
  }
  else
  {
    cat("X is odd\n")
  }
  }
```

Alter this code and verify that it works
```{R}
x=57
if(x<0)
{
  cat("Negative X value\n")
}else {
  if(x%%2==0)
  {
    cat("X is even\n")
  }
  else
  {
    cat("X is odd\n")
  }
}
```


# Compound test conditions

### Using AND (&) and OR(|)

to decide what to do handle this decision

"I walk back the Starbucks some mornings, and while I like their coffee, the
service is slow and I don't like to wait.   So I'll stop for coffee there are 2
or less people in line.    But if they have scones in stock, I'll stop if there
are 4 or less people in line"

Set up variables

people_in_line- which is an integer
scones_in_stock-which is a binary or logical variable

What test condition would you need to figure out if I will stop at starbucks?

Set up an if statement that prints out the decision

```{R}
people_in_line=3
scones_in_stock=TRUE

# write your code here

if(people_in_line <= 2 
   | (people_in_line <= 4 & scones_in_stock)){
  cat("I'm stopping at starbucks")
}else{
  cat("I'm not stopping at starbucks")
}

```

## If-else assignment statements

R has the ability to carry out assignments in an if-else operator

we send in a condition and two possible assignments, the first for TRUE, the 
second for FALSE

it might look like this

```{R}
x=5
y=ifelse(x<10,0.125*x,0.25*x)
y
```

## *Action: Verify that this behaves as expected when x is changed*
```{R}
x=11
y=ifelse(x<10,0.125*x,0.25*x)
y
```

This is not a structure I use much, it does save some time.   I tend to use
the less sophisticated approach shown above.
